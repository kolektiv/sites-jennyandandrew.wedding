      <h1>Please Note!</h1>
      <p>If you're planning on staying at The Star, it's best to book by phone. Online booking tends to show no rooms available &mdash; wrongly... If you do mention that you're booking for the wedding, you should also get a few quid off!</p>

    <h1>Gifts</h1>
    <p>It feels somehow odd to be mentioning this, but quite a few people have asked us if we have a gift list. The short answer is "we haven't", but we are planning on trying to escape for a short honeymoon somewhere soon. If you'd like to make a contribution to that we would be more than grateful &mdash; but please don't feel you have to. More than anything, we'll appreciate you joining us for what we hope will be a fantastic day.</p>

    <h1>Ceremony and Reception</h1>
    <p>Both the ceremony and reception will be taking place in the Star Inn, meaning there's no hassle of travelling around during the day. The ceremony and wedding breakfast are likely to continue until around 6pm, at which point the reception will begin &mdash; there will be food, and music, and it is a pub after all...</p>
    <p>Don't worry about arriving too early &mdash; the pub will be open!</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h1>Accommodation</h1>
    <p>There are several options if you're planning on staying overnight. Staying at <a href="http://www.thestaralfriston.co.uk" title="Book a room at The Star Inn">The Star Inn</a> is probably the easiest &mdash; and if you say you're with the wedding party, you'll receive a discounted room rate.</p>
    <p>Also in Alfriston is <a href="http://www.deansplacehotel.co.uk/" title="Book a room at Deans Place">Deans Place Hotel</a> which also offers excellent accommodation. There are <a href="https://www.booking.com/city/gb/alfriston-east-sussex.en-gb.html" title="Booking.com for Alfriston">other local options</a> within walking distance.</p>
    <p>If you're thinking of staying slightly further afield, both <a href="https://www.booking.com/city/gb/brighton.en-gb.html" title="Booking.com for Brighton">Brighton</a> and <a href="https://www.booking.com/city/gb/eastbourne.en-gb.html" title="Booking.com for Eastbourne">Eastbourne</a> are within practical driving distance and offer a huge variety of accommodation options.</p>

    <h1>Travel</h1>
    <p>Alfriston is not too difficult to get to. Driving directions to <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/The+Star+Inn/@50.8076629,0.1543672,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x47df7af442b48cf7:0xf6f8500e2ca203bd!8m2!3d50.8076629!4d0.1565612" title="See The Star Inn on Google Maps">The Star Inn</a> are straightforward and local traffic tends to be reasonable.</p>
    <p>If you're planning on arriving by public transport, the nearest station is <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Berwick/@50.8339388,0.0828742,12z/data=!4m8!1m2!2m1!1sTrain+Station!3m4!1s0x47df7ab401e99a53:0xaf008587a454b6e0!8m2!3d50.84037!4d0.16605" title="Berwick station on Google Maps">Berwick</a> which has regular direct trains from Brighton (which in turn is easily accessible from London). Berwick Station is a little under three miles from The Star Inn, so while it is walk-able, we would suggest a taxi.</p>
    <p>If you're coming from the surrounding area and would be interested in organised transport to and from the venue (perhaps picking up/dropping off in Brighton and Worthing) please <a href="mailto:andrew@xyncro.com" title="Email Andrew">email us</a> to express an interest &mdash; if enough people would like to do so, we may be able to arrange transport.</p>
