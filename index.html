    <h1>Greetings</h1>
    <p>If you're reading this, you've probably had a Save The Date from us. Maybe you haven't, and we've just told you. Or texted you.</p>
    <p>You're here now though, that's the main thing, and we'd really like you to join us at our wedding, so here are all of the things you need to know. And if, by chance, you need to know something we've forgotten, please <a href="mailto:andrew@xyncro.com" title="Email Andrew">email and we'll help</a>.</p>
    <p>Keep an eye on this site &mdash; we'll add anything helpful we find as we get nearer to the day, along with ways to RSVP, ask questions, etc.</p>

    <h1>Ceremony and Reception</h1>
    <p>Both the ceremony and reception will be taking place in the Star Inn, meaning there's no hassle of travelling around during the day. The ceremony and wedding breakfast are likely to continue until around 6pm, at which point the reception will begin &mdash; there will be food, and music, and it is a pub after all...</p>
    <p>Don't worry about arriving too early &mdash; the pub will be open!</p>

    <h1>Accomodation</h1>
    <p>There are several options if you're planning on staying overnight. Staying at <a href="http://www.thestaralfriston.co.uk" title="Book a room at The Star Inn">The Star Inn</a> is probably the easiest &mdash; and if you say you're with the wedding party, you'll receive a discounted room rate.</p>
    <p>Also in Alfriston is <a href="http://www.deansplacehotel.co.uk/" title="Book a room at Deans Place">Deans Place Hotel</a> which also offers excellent accomodation. There are <a href="https://www.booking.com/city/gb/alfriston-east-sussex.en-gb.html" title="Booking.com for Alfriston">other local options</a> within walking distance.</p>
    <p>If you're thinking of staying slightly further afield, both <a href="https://www.booking.com/city/gb/brighton.en-gb.html" title="Booking.com for Brighton">Brighton</a> and <a href="https://www.booking.com/city/gb/eastbourne.en-gb.html" title="Booking.com for Eastbourne">Eastbourne</a> are within practical driving distance and offer a huge variety of accomodation options.</p>

    <h1>Travel</h1>
    <p>Alfriston is not too difficult to get to. Driving directions to <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/The+Star+Inn/@50.8076629,0.1543672,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x47df7af442b48cf7:0xf6f8500e2ca203bd!8m2!3d50.8076629!4d0.1565612" title="See The Star Inn on Google Maps">The Star Inn</a> are straightforward and local traffic tends to be reasonable.</p>
    <p>If you're planning on arriving by public transport, the nearest station is <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Berwick/@50.8339388,0.0828742,12z/data=!4m8!1m2!2m1!1sTrain+Station!3m4!1s0x47df7ab401e99a53:0xaf008587a454b6e0!8m2!3d50.84037!4d0.16605" title="Berwick station on Google Maps">Berwick</a> which has regular direct trains from Brighton (which in turn is easily accessible from London). Berwick Station is a little under three miles from The Star Inn, so while it is walkable, we would suggest a taxi.</p>
    <p>If you're coming from the surrounding area and would be interested in organised transport to and from the venue (perhaps picking up/dropping off in Brighton and Worthing) please <a href="mailto:andrew@xyncro.com" title="Email Andrew">email us</a> to express an interest &mdash; if enough people would like to do so, we may be able to arrange transport.</p>
